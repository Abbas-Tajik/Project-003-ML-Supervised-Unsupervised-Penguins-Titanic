  Here I worked with both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the Penguins and Titanic
  datasets. I prepared the data, selected features, trained a few different models, and compared their
  results. The aim was to understand how the algorithms behaved and what sort of outcomes they produced.
  It gave me a good foundation in building simple ML workflows.
